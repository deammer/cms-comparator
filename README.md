## ðŸ¤” How does this work?

This website is powered by Gatsby, Netlify, and Airtable.

## ðŸ¤“ Notes and gotchas

- Use `yarn start` to spin up a local dev server at http://localhost:8000. A GraphiQL interface is available at http://localhost:8000/___graphql.
- Don't get too attached to the CSS files, I plan to switch to styled-components ðŸ’… asap.
- Until Airtable implements webhooks, we'll have to deploy things manually in Netlify.
